# Real-Time Face Recognition with Python, OpenCV, and MTCNN

## üìå Function Description

This project implements a real-time face recognition system using webcam input. It detects faces using MTCNN, extracts deep facial embeddings via FaceNet, and compares them against a set of known faces to identify individuals. The system is built for real-time performance and ease of deployment, making it ideal for demonstration, research, and educational purposes.

## üß† What the Code Does

- **Registers known faces** from images in a folder (`known_faces/`)
- **Detects faces** in real-time webcam feed using MTCNN
- **Extracts facial embeddings** using FaceNet
- **Compares embeddings** with registered ones using Euclidean distance
- **Displays bounding boxes** and names of recognized individuals on video stream
